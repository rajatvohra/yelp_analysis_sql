Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	i. 	Attribute table = 10000
	ii. 	Business table = 10000
	iii. 	Category table = 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table = 10000
	v. 	elite_years table = 10000
	vi. 	friend table =  10000
	vii. 	hours table =  10000
	viii. 	photo table = 10000
	ix. 	review table = 10000
	x. 	tip table =  10000
	xi. 	user table =  10000
	
code used for attribute table:

select count(*)
from attribute

--In general replace attribute with any other table for their results
--output:
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    10000 |
+----------+

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

1.	Business = 10,000
2.	Hours = 1562
3.	Category = 2643
4.	Attribute = 1115
5.	Review = 10,000
6.	Checkin = 493
7.	Photo = 10,000
8.	Tip = 537
9.	User = 10,000
10.	Friend = 11
11.	Elite_years = 2780

code used for attribute table:

select count(DISTINCT NAME) +count(DISTINCT BUISSNESSID )+count(DISTINCT VALUE )
from attribute

--output:
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    1115  |
+----------+


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: 
NO , none of the values are null in the Users table .
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select id
, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars
, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos

from user
where id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny = NULL or cool = NULL or fans= NULL or average_stars= NULL or compliment_hot= NULL or compliment_more= NULL or compliment_profile= NULL or compliment_cute= NULL or compliment_list= NULL or compliment_note= NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool= NULL or compliment_funny= NULL or compliment_writer= NULL or compliment_photos= NULL;
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:  1 		max:	5	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:  1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995
sample code:

select min(stars),
max(stars),
avg(stars) 
from review;

output :
+------------+------------+------------+
| min(stars) | max(stars) | avg(stars) |
+------------+------------+------------+
|          1 |          5 |     3.7082 |
+------------+------------+------------+
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	City chosen: Phoenix       , category : Food

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Yes they have different distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	Yes they have different number of reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	'85028' pincode area has a lot of reviews almost 8 times as the next highest with very high star rating implying that the people in that area are happy and content with the restaurent in that area.

SQL code used for analysis:

select business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Phoenix' and category like '%food' 
 group by business.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
	The business that are open have higher ratings than the closed one.
         
ii. Difference 2:
    The business that are open have longer working hours than the closed one. 
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
 select business.name
, business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Phoenix' and category like '%food' 
 group by business.is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         clustering of closed down businesses to find why a certain categoryof business failed in a particular region and try to find the best place to seet up for that businessso as to make it a sucessfull.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    I grouped the data by name and postal code as there many different rows for the same named and located businesses which became too clumsy and then i looked at the category of businesses which closed down the most and the location whihc was most likely to have bad business.
	and with that data and the data about open businesses which have high demand but low sucess with customer satisfaction lead to perfect place to set up shop to become suscessfull.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
 this gave me the most frequent category and pincodes/localities where business closed : pincodes : '852xx' and category : bars
 and further looking at the data I was intrigued where to open the next bar business to make it optimally in the best position to be sucessfull, 
 and 'M4K 1P7' came to mind as it already has demand for bars as evident by the no of reviews and the customers arent happy as the reviews are bad with an average of 2.5.         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

 select business.name
, business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where is_open=='0'
group by name ,postal_code
order by category

output:
